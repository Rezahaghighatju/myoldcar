        <p>we've had a love and fascination with old cars ever since they started rolling off the assembly line. Over the years they have evolved from simple machines designed to get us safely to our destination, to becoming statements about who we are, how we want to be seen, and how we view ourselves as a society. During this time cars have had some radical design changes; some for the better and some for the worse.</p>
        <P class="greentext">The oldest functioning car is La Marquise, a steam-powered, four-wheeled, four-seater vehicle, manufactured by De Dion Bouton et Trépardoux (France) in 1884; three years later it won the world's first automobile race, powering along the 30.5-km (19-mile) track at an average of 42 km/h (26 mph) from Paris to Neuilly, France. The car is fueled by coal, wood and paper and takes approximately 30 minutes to warm up. It has a top speed of 61 km/h (38 mph).

        <h4>How did the first cars work:</h4>
        <p>
        In 1900 wealthy people bought cars for pleasure, comfort, and status. Many doctors bought small, affordable cars because they were more dependable than horses and easier to keep ready. Rural Americans liked cars because they could cover long distances without depending on trains. They carried produce to market, went to stores and movies in town, and even used their cars to plow fields. Families in towns and cities liked cars because they were handy for errands, going to the train station, visiting relatives, going to church, and going on drives in the country. A family’s house with a car in the driveway has been a common sight since about 1910. Young people liked cars because they could go to movies, restaurants, and other fun places instead of staying at home with their parents.
