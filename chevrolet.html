        <p><h4> When Was Chevrolet Founded? </h4></p>
        <p>So, now you know: Louis Chevrolet and William Durant founded Chevy in 1911. However, it’s interesting to note that in 1918 Durant used the company to engineer a reverse merger with GM, which allowed him to reclaim his position as GM’s president. But his takeover didn’t last long. In 1919 he was ousted again, and the new president, Alfred Sloan, chose the Chevrolet brand to be the volume leader in the GM family. Promoting “a car for every purse and every purpose,” Chevrolet overtook Ford as the best selling car in the U.S. by 1929.

        <p><h4>Where Does the Chevy Logo Come From? </h4></p>
        <p>
        The Chevrolet bowtie emblem was first used in 1914 on the H Series Baby Grand and Royal Mail models, and also on the Light Six L Series model. The origin of the logo is the subject of debate. Some say that William C. Durant got the design from wallpaper he saw in a French hotel room, others say that it was based on the logo of the Coalettes coal company, while still others claim that the logo is a stylized version of the Swiss cross, a tribute to the Swiss heritage of Louis Chevrolet. Wherever it came from, the Chevy bow-tie logo is now a classic American icon..</p>
