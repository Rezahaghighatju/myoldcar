        <p><h4> The History of the Four Rings: </h4></p>
        <p>
        The company Wanderer originated as a bicycle repair shop. Later on, they started building bicycles, then motorcycles. In 1913, the company produced its first small car, which was known as “Puppchen” — roughly translated as “moppet” in English.</p>
        <p>The fourth company was DKW, one of the largest motorcycle manufacturers of its time. The Danish founder, Jörgen Skafte Rasmussen, began experimenting with a steam-powered automobile (Dampfkraftwagen - DKW) in 1916. His attempts were fruitless, however, and Rasmussen began developing two-stroke engines. A few years later, DKW was one of the most important motorcycle manufacturers of the pre-war years. DKW started building automobiles in 1928.</p>
        <p>When the Auto Union was formed, the four rings appeared as a symbol for the first time. Later, the brand name Audi took center stage: first in brown, then in red. Starting in 1978, a black oval with white lettering characterized the brand identity. Since 1985, the company and its product have once again shared the same name: Audi. In the 90s, the Ingolstadt company once again concentrated on the rings, this time with a three-dimensional look.</p>
