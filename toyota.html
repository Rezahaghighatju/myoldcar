        <p><h4> History of Toyota </h4></p>
        <p>Toyota's origins lie in the Japanese weaving industry when Sakichi Toyoda invented the world's first automatic loom and, subsequently, set up the Toyoda Spinning and Weaving Company in 1918. His invention reduced defects and increased yields since a loom stopped and would not go on producing imperfect fabric and using up thread after a problem occurred. This principle of designing equipment to stop automatically and call attention to problems immediately (jidoka) remains crucial to the Toyota Production System today.

        <p><h4> Toyota Motor Manufacturing: </h4></p>
        <p>
            Toyota's decision to establish a manufacturing operation in the UK was announced in 1989 and Toyota Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd was established in December that year.
            There are two manufacturing plants in the UK, representing a total investment of £2.75 billion and employing approximately 3,000 members (including Agency).  The vehicle manufacturing plant is located at Burnaston in Derbyshire and the engine manufacturing plant is located at Deeside in North Wales.    
            The first car, a Carina E, drove off the Burnaston production line on 16 December 1992.  This was subsequently replaced by the Avensis in 1997 which saw three generations throughout its history. In July 2018, however, we bid a fond farewell to the 1,936,572nd Toyota Avensis – the final one to drive off our production line.  We are proud to have been the home to the Avensis for over 20 years.          
            In 1998, the Corolla was introduced, which paved the way for the launch of the new generation Corolla in 2001.  Then, in 2007, production of Auris, the new Toyota hatchback, replaced Corolla.  Production of Auris Hybrid, the first full mass-produced hybrid in Europe followed in 2010 and Auris Touring Sport in 2013.The time has come to make way for a new generation of car. Toyota is the leading company for hybrid vehicle development, and the new Corolla with its Touring Sports variant is the future of TMUK – the first model to introduce Toyota’s dual hybrid strategy replaced the Auris when it started to roll off our production lines in January 2019.
            
            The processes at Burnaston include stamping, welding, painting, plastic mouldings and assembly and at Deeside machining, assembly and aluminium casting.</p>
